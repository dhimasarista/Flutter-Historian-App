          "The Battle of Talas or Battle of Artlakh (Chinese: 怛羅斯戰役; pinyin: Dáluósī Zhànyì; Arabic: معركة نهر طلاس, romanized: Maʿrakat nahr Ṭalās, Persian: نبرد طراز Nabard-i Tarāz) was a military encounter and engagement between the Abbasid Caliphate along with its ally, the Tibetan Empire, against the Chinese Tang dynasty. In July 751 AD, Tang and Abbasid forces met in the valley of the Talas River to vie for control over the Syr Darya region of central Asia. According to Chinese sources, after several days of stalemate, the Karluk Turks, originally allied to the Tang Dynasty, defected to the Abbasid Army and tipped the balance of power, resulting in a Tang rout. The defeat marked the end of the Tang westward expansion and resulted in Islamic control of Transoxiana for the next 400 years. However, direct Muslim Arab control ended in 821 when power shifted to the Tahirid dynasty, a culturally Arabized Sunni Muslim dynasty of Persian Dehqan origin. Then the Turkic Ghaznavids took power in 977. Islamic control ended in 1124 when the non-Muslim Qara Khitai conquered Transoxania. Control of the region was economically beneficial for the Abbasid Arabs because it was on the Silk Road. Chinese prisoners captured in the aftermath of the battle are said to have brought paper-making technology to West Asia."),

          "The Mutawakkiliyah Kingdom of Yemen, also known as the Kingdom of Yemen or retrospectively as North Yemen, was a state that existed between 1918 and 1962 in the northern part of the country of Yemen now. The country's capital was Sana'a until 1948, when it was moved to Taiz. The religious leaders of the Zaidiyah, a group within Islam, succeeded in expelling the Ottoman Empire from northern Yemen in the mid-17th century, but after a century, Yemen's unity broke due to the difficulty of governing Yemen's mountainous regions. In 1849, the Ottoman Empire occupied the coastal Tihamah region to pressure the Zaidid Imams to sign the Ottoman suzerainity agreement and allow a small Ottoman army to be stationed in Sana'a. However, the Ottomans were slow to gain control of Yemen and were unable to eliminate resistance from the local Zaidis. In 1913, shortly before World War I, the Ottoman Empire was forced to cede territory to the Zaidis who lived in the highlands. On 30 October 1918, following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Imam Yahya Muhammad Hamiduddin of the al-Qasimi dynasty declared northern Yemen to be an independent sovereign state. In 1926, Imam Yahya proclaimed the Mutawakkiliyah Kingdom of Yemen, then he became king and religious leader (Zaidiyah), and managed to gain international recognition for his new country."),

      location: "Goguryeo(Korea), Manchuria(China)",
      description:
          "The earliest mention of Jumong is in the 4th-century Gwanggaeto Stele. Jumong is the modern Korean transcription of the hanja 朱蒙 Jumong, 鄒牟 Chumo, or 仲牟 Jungmo. The Stele states that Jumong was the first king and ancestor of Goguryeo and that he was the son of the prince of Buyeo and daughter of Habaek (Korean: 하백; Hanja: 河伯), the god of the Amnok River or, according to an alternative interpretation, the sun god Haebak (Korean: 해밝). The Samguk sagi and Samgungnyusa paint additional detail and names Jumong's mother as Yuhwa (Korean: 유화; Hanja: 柳花). Jumong's biological father was said to be a man named Haemosu (Korean: 해모수; Hanja: 解慕漱) who is described as a 'strong man' and 'a heavenly prince.' The river god chased Yuhwa away to the Ubal River (Korean: 우발수; Hanja: 優渤水) due to her pregnancy, where she met and became the concubine of Geumwa. Jumong was well known for his exceptional archery skills. Eventually, Geumwa's sons became jealous of him, and Jumong was forced to leave Eastern Buyeo. The Stele and later Korean sources disagree as to which Buyeo Jumong came from. The Stele says he came from Buyeo and the Samgungnyusa and Samguk sagi say he came from Eastern Buyeo. Jumong eventually made it to Jolbon, where he married Soseono, daughter of its ruler. He subsequently became king himself, founding Goguryeo with a small group of his followers from his native country. A traditional account from the 'Annals of Baekje' section in the Samguk sagi says that Soseono was the daughter of Yeon Tabal, a wealthy influential figure in Jolbon and married to Jumong. However, the same source officially states that the king of Jolbon gave his daughter to Jumong, who had escaped with his followers from Eastern Buyeo, in marriage. She gave her husband, Jumong, financial support in founding the new statelet, Goguryeo. After Yuri, son of Jumong and his first wife, Lady Ye, came from Dongbuyeo and succeeded Jumong, she left Goguryeo, taking her two sons Biryu and Onjo south to found their own kingdoms, one of which was Baekje. Jumong's given surname was 'Hae (Korean: 해; Hanja: 解), the name of the Buyeo rulers. According to the Samgungnyusa, Jumong changed his surname to 'Go' (Korean: 고; Hanja: 高) in conscious reflection of his divine parentage Jumong is recorded to have conquered the tribal states of Biryu (Korean: 비류국; Hanja: 沸流國) in 36 BC, Haeng-in (Korean: 행인국; Hanja: 荇人國) in 33 BC, and Northern Okjeo in 28 BC."),

          "During the Asuka period (538-710), the ancient Japanese state of Yamato gradually became a centralized state. The ancient Japanese state already had laws as stated in the Taihō Law and the points of the Taika Reform. The arrival of Buddhism in Japan resulted in people no longer making kofun-shaped tombs. Buddhism entered Japan around 538 through Baekje which received military support from Japan. The spread of Buddhism in Japan was carried out by the ruling circles. Prince Shōtoku dedicated himself to the spread of Buddhism and Chinese culture in Japan. He is credited with drafting the 17-article Constitution which brought peace to Japan. The constitution he drafted was influenced by Confucian ideas about the morals and virtues that society expected of government officials and the emperor's servants. In a letter that the envoy of the Japanese Empire delivered to the Chinese Empire in 607 were written the words, \"The emperor of the land of the rising sun (Japan) sends a letter to the emperor of the land of the setting sun (China)\". The letter caused the anger of the Chinese emperor. Beginning with the Taika Reform Order in 645, Japan increasingly actively adopted Chinese cultural practices, reorganized the government, and drafted penal codes (Ritsuryō) following the Chinese administrative structure of the time. The term Nihon (日本) also came into use as a country name from Asuka's time."),

      description:
          'The Fall of Constantinople, also known as the Conquest of Constantinople, was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by the Ottoman Empire. The city fell on 29 May 1453 as part of the culmination of a 53-day siege which had begun on 6 April. The city\'s collapse is usually agreed on as marking the end of the Middle Ages. The attacking Ottoman Army, which significantly outnumbered Constantinople\'s defenders, was commanded by the 21-year-old Sultan Mehmed II (later nicknamed "the Conqueror"), while the Byzantine army was led by Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. After conquering the city, Mehmed II made Constantinople the new Ottoman capital, replacing Adrianople. The conquest of Constantinople and the fall of the Byzantine Empire was a watershed of the Late Middle Ages, marking the effective end of the last remains of the Roman Empire, a state which began in roughly 27 BC and had lasted nearly 1500 years. Among many modern historians, the Fall of Constantinople is considered the end of the medieval period. The city\'s fall also stood as a turning point in military history. Since ancient times, cities and castles had depended upon ramparts and walls to repel invaders. The Walls of Constantinople, especially the Theodosian Walls, were some of the most advanced defensive systems in the world at the time. These fortifications were overcome with the use of gunpowder, specifically in the form of large cannons and bombards, heralding a change in siege warfare.'),

      location: "World",
      description:
          'History records that European nations decided to undertake expeditions or explorations to other parts of the world since the 15th century AD, including to the archipelago or present-day Indonesia. This period was later called the age of ocean exploration. Ocean exploration is also known as the era of the age of discovery. This era began when the Eastern Roman Empire collapsed after fighting Islamic rule. Exploration of the oceans by Europeans then became conquest and colonialism. The Portuguese became the first European nation to sail to the Archipelago. Alfonso de Albuqueque commanded some 18 ships carrying 1,200 people. This Portuguese convoy conquered Malacca in 1511, then targeted Maluku in 1512. From this, the history of colonialization in Indonesia began. Spices were the main reason for the Portuguese visiting the Archipelago. This achievement from the Portuguese was then followed by its neighboring kingdom, namely Spain. The Portuguese and Spanish had been involved in a conflict in Maluku. The Portuguese allied with the Kingdom of Ternate against the Spanish who embraced the Kingdom of Tidore. Not only Spain and Portugal, the exploration of the oceans that transformed into colonialism and imperialism was later followed by other European nations, including the Netherlands, France, Britain, Italy, Belgium and Germany. So, what was the background for Europeans to explore the oceans? One of the main causes was the fall of Constantinople in 1453, from the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire to the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Mehmed II. The conquest of Constantinople (now Istanbul) became one of the important milestones that changed the history of human civilization, namely the exploration of European nations.')
